             The prediction is computed using the machine learning algorithm - Gradient Boosting.<br>
             For this supervised learning problem, there are total over 7000 training examples with labels.
             Model performance is measured by Area Under the ROC curve (as shown in the plot below), in order to comprehensively consider precision and recall.
             10 fold Cross validation was performed to ensure no overfitting, and the trained model achieved average AUC score of 0.846.

             Concretely, in this problem all the input fields are treated as potential features, while the outcome of whether the customer quits is the label.<br>
             Each feature is not equally important on impacting the result.
             Using Random Forest Classifier, we can visually rank the features' relative importance as shown below:

         </div>
         <div style="color:black">
             From the plot we can see that 3 features are obviously more important than others.
             The top 3 important features are: Total Charges (feature #3 on plot), Monthly Charges (feature #2 on plot) and length of membership (feature #1 on plot).
             In addition, these three factors are also correlated as shown in the heat map below:
         </div>

             <span><p>Heat map of features</p></span>
         </div>
         <div style="color:black">
             Intuitively it's not surprising to see that the charges to a customer, either total wise or monthly wise,
             are the determining factor that impact customer's loyaty, especially when the competitor company have better offers. <br>
             Interestingly, the length of customer's membership plays the next critical role next to price.
             The longer a customer has been work with a company, the lower possibility this customer will quit. <br>
             In another word, newly subscribed customer have higher potential to leave.
             With this finding, some promotion offers may be provided especially targeting the newer customers...<br>
